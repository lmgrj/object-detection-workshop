# Workshop: Object detection with Deep Learning

## Hands-on 1: Implementing Faster R-CNN (almost) from scratch

Consists of a Jupyter Notebook that will guide you to complete the implementation of a
Faster R-CNN model for object detection.

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Execute the `download_checkpoint.sh` script from the base directory in order to
   download the pre-trained checkpoint:

    ```bash
    cd object-detection-workshop
    ./download_checkpoint.sh
    ```

3. Install the auxiliary library `workshop`:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

4. Run Jupyter Notebook from the base directory:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5. Open the notebook **Implementing Faster R-CNN.ipynb**.

6. Read the instructions carefully and complete everything :)

## Hands on 2: using Luminoth for real world object detection

Guided demo of [Luminoth](http://luminoth.ai/) toolkit, which will teach you the most
important functionalities and how to train your own models.
